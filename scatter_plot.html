<h1>Scatter Plot: Headroom vs Sleeping Length</h1>
<p>The following scatter plot shows all tents plotted by headroom and sleeping length. Panel pullouts are used if available. Tents are grouped using Mean-Shift clustering.</p>
<p>These are real-world, hand measurements of each tent's usable space. Sleeping length is measured 12" off the ground. Headroom is measured 36" off the ground.</p>

<h1>Scatter Plot: Roominess vs. Weight</h1>
<p>The following scatter plot shows all tents plotted by roominess and weight. Roominess is scored on a scale of 0 to 10. Half of the score is based on sleeping length, the other half on headroom and footprint width. Panel pullouts are used if available. Weight is measured in ounces. Tents are grouped using Mean-Shift clustering.</p>
<p>These are real-world, hand measurements of each tent's usable space. Sleeping length is measured 12" off the ground. Headroom is measured 36" off the ground.</p>

<h1>Roominess Breakdown</h1>
<p>The roominess of the previous scatter plot broken down by sleeping length, headroom, and footprint width. This chart also includes tarps.</p>
<p>These are real-world, hand measurements of each tent's usable space. Sleeping length is measured 12" off the ground. Headroom is measured 36" off the ground.</p>
