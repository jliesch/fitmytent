<h1>About</h1>
<p>The goal of Fit My Tent is to provide real-world measurements for the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #50b42a">usable space</span> of a variety of tents.</p>

<td style="max-width: 30em; vertical-align: top">
<p>The diagram to the right shows a 6-foot tall person sitting up and laying down in several styles of tents.</p>
<p>Each style of tent makes different tradeoffs. These tradeoffs affect whether the tent provides more sleeping length, more headroom, or both.</p>
<p>Finding the right tent that fits you could be a long process of trial and error. Or you could use our measurement system to find your perfect fit.</p>

<p>This measurement system was originally proposed on Andrew Skurka's blog: <a href="https://andrewskurka.com/backpacking-shelters-big-tall-sprawwwl/">Backpacking shelters for the BIG & tall, and those who sprawwwl</a>. I owe a great deal of gratitude to Andrew for helping me refine this idea and giving me a platform to publish it on. Check out that post for background on why this measurement system is superior to the typical measurements of footprint area and peak height.</p>
