Tent measurement and fitting website

The goal of Fit My Tent is to provide real-world measurements for the usable space of a variety of tents.

## Open Source

The tent database and site are open source. It is super basic: HTML, CSS, javascript. Nothing else. The code quality is admittedly pretty crappy. If there is any interest from the community I will refactor it in a way that would improve collaboration.
